DONE - You should not call make in the driver. 

DONE - "ret" is not allowed to exit the program. You should use a syscall or call "exit", so it return an exit code. 

DONE - I should not need to change paths in your driver to be able to compile a script. It should be possible to write "./x86-64-driver.sh example.calc" with any .calc file. They should not need to be in the testprogs folder. 

DONE - The compiler can't compile the "pi.calc" test file. This file should be possible to compile to be given a passing grade.

DONE - The "looptest.calc" do not produce the correct output. It outputs only 1s in a loop that never ends. 

DONE - You should not add extra things to the outputs of the compiled programs. Meaning "gcd.calc" should output "244" two times. Nothing else. 

DONE - You should follow the basic folder structure as stated in the assignment instructions.
